Principles of Computer Science and Programming

## 1 SOLID Principles
### 1-1 Single Responsibility Principle:
A class should only have one reason to change; *Separation of concerns*.
    
### 1-2 Open-Closed Principle:
Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.

### 1-3 Liskov Substitution Principle:
You should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype.
	
### 1-4 Interface Segregation Principle:
Don't put too much into an interface; *YAGNI*; split into separate interfaces.

### 1-5 Dependency Inversion Principle:
High-level modules should not depend upon low-level ones; use abstraction.
